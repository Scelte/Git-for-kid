All working process with Git and GitHub

git push --set-upstream origin fix_error - push and create a branch on remote GitHub


after that i'll need to send a message about pull request 

hack - use split for GitHub GUI

git push origin --delete fix_error

clone - branch - change - push branch - pull request - review - merge - detele branch
