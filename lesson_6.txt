How to ignore and restore files 

Basic knowlegment:
1. touch exmaple.txt - Untracked
2. git add example.txt - Staged 
3. git commit -m "comment" - Copy in Local Repository
4. git push  - Copy Local Repository to Remote 

git log -1(last)-p(what's happend) - Check the history of commits 

i made a mistake 

git checkout -- name.file - restore version on stage step  - after git commit - no
git diff --staged  - i show's how log will be looks like if you will do  git commit - show diffent with staged and last commit
